This is the API documentation of PredictionIO.

If you are building a prediction engine, the most interesting package would be
[[io.prediction.controller]]. If your prediction engine uses Event Store, you
may also want to look at [[io.prediction.data.storage]].

Classes and methods marked with <span class="experimental badge" style="float:
none;">Experimental</span> are user-facing features which have not been
officially adopted by the PredictionIO project. These are subject to change or
removal in minor releases.

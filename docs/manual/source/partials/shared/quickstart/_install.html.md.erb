First you need to [install PredictionIO <%= data.versions.pio %>](/install) (if
you haven't done it).

Let's say you have installed PredictionIO at `/home/yourname/PredictionIO/`.
For convenience, add PredictionIO's binary command path to your `PATH`, i.e.
`/home/yourname/PredictionIO/bin`:

```
$ PATH=$PATH:/home/yourname/PredictionIO/bin; export PATH
```

NOTE: If you installed from AWS Marketplace, the path is located at
`/opt/PredictionIO/bin`.

Once you have completed the installation process, please make sure all the
components (PredictionIO Event Server, Elasticsearch, and HBase) are up and
running.

NOTE: You can skip `pio-start-all` if you have launched from the AWS
Marketplace. All components should have been started automatically.

```
$ pio-start-all
```

You can check the status by running:

```
$ pio status
```

NOTE: To further troubleshoot, please see [FAQ - Using
PredictionIO](/resources/faq/#using-predictionio).

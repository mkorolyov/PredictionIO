Let's assume you want to use this engine in an application named "MyApp1".
You will need to collect some training data for machine learning modeling.
You can generate an **App ID** and **Access Key** that represent "MyApp1" on the Event Server easily:

```
$ pio app new MyApp1
```

You should find the following in the console output:

```
...
[INFO] [App$] Initialized Event Store for this app ID: 1.
[INFO] [App$] Created new app:
[INFO] [App$]       Name: MyApp1
[INFO] [App$]         ID: 1
[INFO] [App$] Access Key: 3mZWDzci2D5YsqAnqNnXH9SB6Rg3dsTBs8iHkK6X2i54IQsIZI1eEeQQyMfs7b3F
```

Take note of the **Access Key** and **App ID**. You will need the **Access Key**
to refer to "MyApp1" when you collect data. At the same time, you will use **App
ID** to refer to "MyApp1" in engine code.

`$ pio app list` will return a list of names and IDs of apps created in the Event Server.

```
$ pio app list
[INFO] [App$]                 Name |   ID |                                                       Access Key | Allowed Event(s)
[INFO] [App$]               MyApp1 |    1 | 3mZWDzci2D5YsqAnqNnXH9SB6Rg3dsTBs8iHkK6X2i54IQsIZI1eEeQQyMfs7b3F | (all)
[INFO] [App$]               MyApp2 |    2 | io5lz6Eg4m3Xe4JZTBFE13GMAf1dhFl6ZteuJfrO84XpdOz9wRCrDU44EUaYuXq5 | (all)
[INFO] [App$] Finished listing 2 app(s).

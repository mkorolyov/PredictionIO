### Building

Start with building your *<%= engine_name %>* engine.

```
$ pio build
```
This command should take few minutes for the first time; all subsequent builds
should be less than a minute. You can also run it with --verbose to see all log
messages.

Upon successful build, you should see a console message similar to the
following.

```
[INFO] [Console$] Your engine is ready for training.
```

### Training the Predictive Model

Train your engine.

```
$ pio train
```

When your engine is trained successfully, you should see a console message
similar to the following.

```
[INFO] [CoreWorkflow$] Training completed successfully.
```

### Deploying the Engine

Now your engine is ready to deploy.

```
$ pio deploy
```

This will deploy an engine that binds to http://localhost:8000. You can visit
that page in your web browser to check its status.
